# What the Data Says: Movie Rentals Analyzed with SQL

## Why
I created this project to practice **real-world SQL**, not just basic queries.
The idea was simple: take a movie rental database and use SQL to understand
how the business actually works — customers, movies, and revenue.

This project helped me think like a **data analyst**, not just a student.

## Tools & Skills
- SQL (JOINs, Subqueries, CTEs)
- Aggregations & Filtering
- Analytical thinking with business focus

## What I Explored
- Which movies are rented the most  
- How customers behave over time  
- Which categories perform best  
- Business insights hidden inside the data  

## Project Layout
- `queries/` → All SQL queries used  
- `data/` → Dataset (if applicable)  
- `screenshots/` → Query results  

## Let’s Connect
I’m actively looking for:
- Data Analyst Internships  
- Entry-Level Data Analyst Roles  
- Learning & Freelance Opportunities
